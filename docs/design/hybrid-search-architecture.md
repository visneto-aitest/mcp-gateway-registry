# Hybrid Search Architecture

This document describes the hybrid search design for MCP servers and A2A agents in the registry.

## Overview

The registry implements hybrid search that combines semantic (vector) search with lexical (keyword) matching. This approach provides both conceptual understanding of queries and precise matching when users reference entities by name.

## Search Flow

### 1. Query Processing

When a search query arrives:

1. **Embedding Generation**: Query is converted to a vector embedding using the configured model (Amazon Bedrock, OpenAI, or local sentence-transformers)

2. **Tokenization**: Query is split into meaningful keywords
   - Non-word characters are removed
   - Stopwords filtered (a, the, is, are, etc.)
   - Tokens shorter than 3 characters removed

### 2. Dual Search Strategy

**Vector Search (Semantic)**
- Uses HNSW index on DocumentDB (production) or application-level cosine similarity on MongoDB CE
- Finds conceptually similar content even with different wording
- Returns results sorted by cosine similarity
- DocumentDB uses configurable `efSearch` parameter (default 100) for HNSW recall quality
- Minimum `k=50` ensures small collections are fully covered

**Keyword Search (Lexical)**
- Regex matching on path, name, description, tags, metadata_text, and tool names/descriptions
- Catches explicit references that semantic search might miss
- Runs as separate query due to DocumentDB limitations (no `$unionWith` support)
- Each query keyword is matched independently using case-insensitive regex
- Keyword matches from both vector results and separate keyword query are merged, with the highest boost per document kept

### 3. Score Combination

The final relevance score combines both approaches:

```
normalized_vector_score = (cosine_similarity + 1.0) / 2.0   # Map [-1,1] to [0,1]
text_boost_contribution = text_boost * 0.1                   # Scale boost down
relevance_score = normalized_vector_score + text_boost_contribution
relevance_score = clamp(relevance_score, 0.0, 1.0)
```

The multiplier `0.1` is consistent across both DocumentDB and MongoDB CE search paths.

Text boost values (cumulative per keyword match):
| Match Location | Boost Value |
|----------------|-------------|
| Path           | +5.0        |
| Name           | +3.0        |
| Description    | +2.0        |
| Tags           | +1.5        |
| Metadata       | +1.0        |
| Tool (each)    | +1.0        |

### 4. Score-Before-Filter Pattern

All candidate results are scored before applying the distribution filter. This ensures the highest-scoring documents are selected:

1. Vector search returns candidates (up to `k` results)
2. Keyword search returns additional matches (merged by highest boost per document)
3. Every candidate receives a hybrid score (vector + text boost)
4. All candidates are sorted by hybrid score descending
5. The `_distribute_results()` function selects up to `max_results` items using global ranking with competitive soft caps (see [Result Distribution](#result-distribution) below)

This prevents lower-scoring documents from consuming a slot before higher-scoring documents are evaluated.

### 5. Diagnostic Logging

Both search paths emit a `Score for` log line for every candidate, enabling search quality debugging:

```
Score for 'Context7' (type=mcp_server): vector=0.3412, normalized_vector=0.6706,
  text_boost=8.0, boost_contrib=0.8000, final=1.0000
```

### 6. Result Distribution

The `max_results` parameter (range 1-50, default 10) controls how many total results are returned. Results are distributed across entity types using **global ranking with competitive soft caps**.

#### Algorithm

The `_distribute_results()` function in `search_repository.py` implements a two-pass approach:

**Pass 1 -- Pick with soft caps:**
1. Sort all scored candidates by `relevance_score` descending (all entity types on the same 0-1 scale)
2. Walk the sorted list, picking items up to `max_results`
3. If a type reaches its soft cap (`ceil(max_results * 0.6)`), check whether other entity types still have results remaining below in the ranking
4. If other types are waiting: skip this item (enforce cap for diversity)
5. If no other types remain: lift the cap (no point leaving slots empty)

**Pass 2 -- Backfill:**
6. If pass 1 didn't fill all `max_results` slots (because some items were skipped), backfill from the skipped items in score order

#### Constants

| Constant | Value | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `SOFT_CAP_RATIO` | `0.6` | No single entity type can claim more than 60% of slots when other types are competing |
| Tool extraction limit | `max(3, ceil(max_results * 0.6))` | Scales tool extraction with `max_results`, minimum 3 for backward compatibility |
| Pipeline candidate limit | `max(max_results * 3, 50)` | Fetch enough candidates for global ranking |

#### Examples

**Example 1: Only servers exist (max_results=10)**

A registry with 20 MCP servers and no agents, tools, or skills.

```
Candidates (sorted by relevance_score):
  S(0.95), S(0.93), S(0.91), S(0.89), S(0.87), S(0.85),
  S(0.83), S(0.81), S(0.79), S(0.77), S(0.75), ...

soft_cap = ceil(10 * 0.6) = 6

Pass 1:
  Pick S(0.95) ... S(0.85) -> 6 servers (cap reached)
  S(0.83): cap hit, check remaining types -> only mcp_server left
           -> no competition, cap lifted
  Pick S(0.83) ... S(0.77) -> 4 more servers

Result: 10 servers (no artificial limit when only one type exists)
```

**Example 2: Mixed types (max_results=10)**

A registry with servers, agents, and tools.

```
Candidates (sorted by relevance_score):
  S(0.95), S(0.93), S(0.91), A(0.88), S(0.87), T(0.85),
  S(0.83), A(0.80), S(0.78), T(0.75), A(0.72), S(0.70)

soft_cap = ceil(10 * 0.6) = 6

Pass 1:
  Pick S(0.95), S(0.93), S(0.91)          -> 3 servers
  Pick A(0.88)                              -> 1 agent
  Pick S(0.87), T(0.85), S(0.83), A(0.80) -> 2 more servers, 1 tool, 1 agent
  Pick S(0.78)                              -> 6th server (cap reached)
  T(0.75): pick                             -> 2nd tool
  A(0.72): pick                             -> 10th total (done)

Result: 6 servers, 3 agents, 1 tool = 10 total
  (diverse results, highest relevance wins, cap prevents server dominance)
```

**Example 3: Small max_results (max_results=5)**

```
soft_cap = ceil(5 * 0.6) = 3

With mixed types, the dominant type gets at most 3 slots,
leaving 2 for other types. Similar diversity to the previous
default behavior of 3 per type.
```

**Example 4: Large max_results with one dominant type (max_results=50)**

A registry with 40 servers, 3 agents, and 2 tools.

```
soft_cap = ceil(50 * 0.6) = 30

Pass 1:
  Servers fill 30 slots (cap reached while agents/tools still available)
  3 agents and 2 tools fill 5 slots
  Cap lifted for servers (no more agents/tools)
  12 more servers fill remaining slots

Result: 42 servers, 3 agents, 2 tools = 47 total
  (all available entities returned, servers got the rest)
```

#### Backward Compatibility

With the default `max_results=10`, the soft cap is 6. In a typical registry with multiple entity types, results look similar to the previous 3-per-type behavior: the dominant type gets 5-6 results, others share the rest. The key difference is that `max_results=50` now actually returns up to 50 results instead of being capped at 15 (3 per type * 5 types).

#### Applies to All Search Paths

The same `_distribute_results()` function is used by all three search code paths:

| Search Path | When Used | Integration |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| Hybrid (DocumentDB) | Production with vector index | Scored tuples fed directly to `_distribute_results()` |
| Client-side (MongoDB CE) | Local dev without vector search | Dict results converted to tuples, then distributed |
| Lexical-only | When embedding model unavailable | Scores computed from `text_boost / MAX_LEXICAL_BOOST`, then distributed |

### 7. Result Structure

Search returns grouped results (up to `max_results` total, distributed across entity types):

```json
{
  "servers": [
    {
      "path": "/context7",
      "server_name": "Context7 MCP Server",

  - `server_name`, `num_tools`, `backend_count`
  - `backend_paths[]` (list of backend server paths)
  - `required_scopes[]`, `supported_transports[]`
  - `created_by`

**Search result structure:**
```json
{
  "virtual_servers": [
    {
      "entity_type": "virtual_server",
      "path": "/virtual/dev-tools",
      "server_name": "Dev Tools",
      "description": "Aggregated development tools",
      "relevance_score": 0.85,
      "tags": ["development", "tools"],
      "backend_paths": ["/github", "/jira"],
      "tool_count": 5,
      "matching_tools": [
        {"tool_name": "github_search"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Metadata in Search

Custom metadata from servers, agents, skills, and virtual servers is included in both semantic embeddings and keyword search. Metadata is flattened to a text string using `_flatten_metadata_to_text()`:

- Each key name is included as a token
- Scalar values are converted to strings
- List values have each item converted to a string
- Nested dict values have each value converted to a string

For example, a server with metadata `{"source": "agentcore-sync", "region": "us-east-1"}` produces the metadata text: `source agentcore-sync region us-east-1`.

This flattened text is:
1. Appended to `text_for_embedding` so semantic search captures metadata meaning
2. Stored in `metadata_text` field for keyword/regex matching
3. Matched in the `$or` keyword filter alongside path, name, description, tags, and tools
4. Scored with +1.0 text boost when matched in the `_build_text_boost_stage` pipeline

Metadata sources per entity type:
| Entity Type    | Metadata Source |
|----------------|-----------------|
| MCP Server     | `server_info.get("metadata", {})` |
| A2A Agent      | `agent_card.get("metadata", {})` |
| Agent Skill    | Author, version, `extra` dict (custom key-value pairs), registry_name |
| Virtual Server | `created_by` field |

## Backend Implementations

### DocumentDB (Production)
- Native HNSW vector index with `$search` aggregation pipeline
- Keyword query runs separately and merges results (no `$unionWith` support)
- Text boost calculated in aggregation pipeline using `$regexMatch`

### MongoDB CE (Development/Local)
- No native vector search support (`$vectorSearch` not available)
- Falls back to application-level search (in Python backend, not the calling agent):
  1. Fetch all documents with embeddings from collection
  2. Calculate cosine similarity in Python code
  3. Apply keyword matching and text boost in application
  4. Sort and limit results
- Same API contract as DocumentDB implementation

## Lexical Fallback Mode

When the embedding model is unavailable (misconfigured, network issues, API key expired, model not found), the search system automatically degrades to **lexical-only mode** instead of failing entirely.

### How It Works

1. **Detection**: On the first search request, if the embedding model fails to generate a query vector, the `_embedding_unavailable` flag is set in `DocumentDBSearchRepository`
2. **Fallback**: All subsequent searches skip embedding generation and use `_lexical_only_search()` instead
3. **Error Caching**: The `SentenceTransformersClient` caches load errors in `_load_error` to avoid repeated download attempts (e.g., hitting HuggingFace on every call)
4. **Indexing**: When the model is unavailable during startup, servers and agents are indexed without embeddings. Documents are stored with empty embedding vectors
5. **Response**: The API response includes a `search_mode` field set to `"lexical-only"` (instead of the normal `"hybrid"`) so callers know the search quality is reduced

### Lexical-Only Search Flow

### Scoring in Lexical-Only Mode

In lexical-only mode, the text boost score is normalized to a 0-1 range using a fixed denominator (`MAX_LEXICAL_BOOST = 13.5`):

```
relevance_score = text_boost / MAX_LEXICAL_BOOST
```

The same boost weights from hybrid mode apply:

| Match Location | Boost Value |
|----------------|-------------|
| Path           | +5.0        |
| Name           | +3.0        |
| Description    | +2.0        |
| Tags           | +1.5        |
| Metadata       | +1.0        |
| Tool (each)    | +1.0        |

### Recovery

When the embedding model becomes available again (e.g., after a restart with correct configuration), the system automatically returns to full hybrid search mode. The `_embedding_unavailable` flag and `_load_error` cache are per-process and reset on restart.

## HNSW Tuning (DocumentDB)

The DocumentDB `$search` pipeline includes two tunable parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `k` | `max(max_results * 3, 50)` | Number of nearest neighbors to retrieve. Minimum 50 ensures small collections are fully covered. |
| `efSearch` | `100` (configurable via `VECTOR_SEARCH_EF_SEARCH`) | Controls HNSW recall quality. Higher values improve recall at the cost of query latency. Default DocumentDB value is ~40, which can miss documents in small collections. |

The `efSearch` setting is configured in `registry/core/config.py` as `vector_search_ef_search`.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Result Distribution**: Global ranking with competitive soft caps limits results to `max_results` (default 10, max 50). The distribution algorithm is O(n) where n is the candidate set size (at most 150 documents).
2. **Score-Before-Filter**: All candidates scored and sorted before applying the distribution filter
3. **Index Reuse**: HNSW index parameters (m=16, efConstruction=128) optimized for recall
4. **efSearch Tuning**: Set to 100 for near-exact recall in typical deployments
5. **Embedding Caching**: Lazy-loaded model with singleton pattern
6. **Keyword Fallback**: Separate query ensures explicit matches are not missed
7. **Error Caching**: Failed model loads are cached to avoid repeated download/API attempts

## Example: Why Hybrid Matters

Query: "context7"

- **Vector-only**: Might return documentation servers with similar semantic content
- **Keyword-only**: Finds exact match but misses related servers
- **Hybrid**: Ranks /context7 at top (keyword boost) while including semantically similar alternatives
